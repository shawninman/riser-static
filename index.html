            <p class="mt-4">
                I've been a software-focused professional for over 20 years. During that time I've worked on a ton
                and I've worked with a ton of technologies. Most notably, I make web apps with Python and Django.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Recently, I was the CTO for a software healthcare startup which
                <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/02/15/917459/0/en/K2M-Introduces-Balance-ACS-A-Platform-of-Products-Services-Research-Applying-Three-Dimensional-Solutions-to-Improve-Quality-Patient-Outcomes-for-Spine-Patients.html" class="underline">successfully exited</a> to
                a publicly-traded medical device company. I'm really proud of what we accomplished, how we iterated on strategy over the years, and how the platform scaled over its lifetime.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Not sure what all that means? <span class="font-bold">No sweat.</span> One of the things I'm best at is working with people who don't yet know exactly
                what they need.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                That phase of the project when you know <span class="italic">where</span> you need to go, but you don't know
                how to get there? I <span class="italic">live</span> in that place. I love working with people to understand
                their needs and build things to solve their problems.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-center font-bold">Fun things.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-center font-bold">Beautiful things.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                I've worked in a ton of industries and built platforms for healthcare, point-of-sale,
                inventory management, and social media infrastructure. You name it. Maybe your project falls
                outside those domains. Awesome - I love a challenge.

                    It is such a pleasure working with Shawn. He is considerate, communicative and able to adapt as our projects have evolved. He is extremely knowledgeable and adept at creating systems that work just as we specâ€™d. He also provides great creative insight which make those systems all the better. I cannot wait to work with him again!

                Whether you're here on behalf of a full-fledged corporation or some dream idea, it's a big deal choosing to
                work with someone. Frankly, you shouldn't leave it up to this site to convice you of anything. But now you know
                a little about me. I'd love to know about you. Get in touch and let's talk things over.
